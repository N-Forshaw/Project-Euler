# Project-Euler
Programs used to solve the problems found at projecteuler.net

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

To date (24/05/2020) I have solved the first 22 problems. However this was several years ago, and so I'm currently re-doing those problems to have them uploaded here.
