### Project Euler
### Problem 4

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Notes
# There are ~900 3 digit numbers, so 900^2 combinations. However by starting from the top down I can minimse how many I need to check. That being said,
# There's a lot less 6 digit palimdromes (999^2 = 998001, so all products of 3 digit numbers will have max 6 digits). The palindrome will also be less
# than 999^2, so the highest possible palindrome is 997799, then 996699 etc, and so on.
